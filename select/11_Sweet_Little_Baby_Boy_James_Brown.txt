Sweet little baby boy
In his manger, dear
Got to see what he had to go through
For coming to this world and be

Sweet little baby boy
That's the Saviour born for
On a day that was so cold, oh
Yes, I wanna talk much more

Oh, but the world that would be happy and bright
As all things are on a Christmas night
Can't you see I'm lyin' there, no, on a cradle battered and torn
Yes, in that battered cradle, the Saviour was born

Sweet little baby boy, sweet little baby boy
To the world known is bad enough
But the love and loved His wishes
And to humanity there will be a son

Hopin', away one more time
That everything has fazed out on a Christmas night
Can't you see I'm lyin' there, no
On a cradle so battered and torn, yes, in that battered cradle
Saviour of the world was born

Sweet little baby boy
But the world You know is bad enough
But to love and be loved was his wishes
And to humanity there will be a son

Sweet little baby boy
Sweet little baby boy
Sweet little baby boy, no

Makes my heat bleed
Think about that sweet little baby boy

Do you know he taught us how to walk
Gave us strength, no, no, no so we could talk
Gave sight to blind, He gave sight to the blind
And He, and He restored my mind

Sweet little baby boy
Do you know the Man, I remember, I remember
My mother told me this story when I was a little boy
The greatest love story ever told

She said He, she said He saved, He saved, He saved somebody
And Lord, He blessed his soul
Sweet little baby boy, no
Sweet little baby boy

No, sweet little baby boy
Sweet little baby boy
Feel so, feel, so
Sweet little baby boy
Yeah, breathe now
Little baby boy

Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes I wonder
Sometimes, sometimes
Sweet, sweet little baby boy
